 ### CPSC 120

 * Lab 7

     Because I was always fascinated about how the game Blackjack worked, 
     Lab 7, Part 2 was a favorite. For the first time, I was able to build 
     functions that calculated the right value of a Blackjack hand regardless 
     of how many Aces were dealt.

 * Lab 6

     Lab 6 (part 2) was one of my favorite labs this semester since I had to  
     build code that used if statements, which I found fascinating. I was pleased   
     to discover that I could develop code for the blackjack game. This section taught 
     me how to write if statements, which I found tough, but this lab was one of my favorites.

 * Lab 1

     Lab 1 (part 1) was one of my favorite labs this semester because it was my first time coding 
     and I knew nothing about the computer science area. I was overjoyed to learn that this is only 
     the beginning of something significant in my career. I learnt how to present an output on the 
     screen as Hello World! in this lab.
